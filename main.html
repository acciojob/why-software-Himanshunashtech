    <h1>Why I Want to Become a Developer?</h1>
    <p>I want to become a software developer because I'm fascinated by the power of technology to solve real-world problems. The ability to create something from nothing using just logic and creativity is incredibly rewarding. I enjoy the continuous learning process in this field and the opportunity to build solutions that can improve people's lives. Software development combines analytical thinking with creative problem-solving, which makes it both challenging and deeply satisfying.</p>
